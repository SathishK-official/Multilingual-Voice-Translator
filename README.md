🔊 Multilingual Voice Translation – "Maathi Tharan Sollu"
Project Overview:

The Multilingual Voice Translation web application, titled "Maathi Tharan Sollu", is an interactive voice translation tool that allows real-time speech recognition and multilingual translation across five major Indian languages: English, Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, and Malayalam. Built with a sleek and responsive HTML/CSS front end and powered by browser-native speech recognition (using webkitSpeechRecognition), the tool offers users a seamless experience to speak in one language and receive an instant translation in another.

Key Features:

🎙️ Voice Input Interface: Users can speak directly into their microphone to initiate real-time transcription.

🌐 Five Language Support: Supports translation between English, Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, and Malayalam.

🔁 Bi-directional Translation: Select both source and target languages flexibly from the dropdown.

⚡ Real-time Feedback: Displays live speech transcription and translation results on-screen.

🎨 Modern UI/UX: Stylish and immersive interface with dynamic visual effects and Tamil language touches for authenticity.

🛑 Stop Button Functionality: Users can stop voice capture at any time and re-initiate it easily.

🔄 Mock Translation Logic: Demonstrates multilingual conversion via a simulated translation engine (ideal for prototyping and further integration with APIs like Google Translate or Azure Cognitive Services).

Technologies Used:

HTML5, CSS3 (with custom fonts and animation)

JavaScript for dynamic behavior

Web Speech API (webkitSpeechRecognition)

Mock JSON-based translation logic (can be upgraded to use actual translation APIs)

Use Case Scenarios:

Language learning and educational assistance

Multilingual customer service interactions

Real-time community communication support in diverse linguistic environments

Personal translator in multilingual households or field settings
